Thanks for submitting an issue to the repository. 

***Important**:  

A merged PR will make you appear in the contributor list. It will, however, be considered a donation of your work to this project. You are still bound by the conditions of the license, meaning that you are **not considered an author, copyright holder, or owner** of the content once it has been merged in.

Submitting a PR will mean that you acknowledge that you understand that you give up any claims of authorship, ownership, or copyright (Max and Kjell excluded).

## Just a typo? 

That's great. The best thing you can do is make the change and check in the `qmd` file(s). Please don't include intermediate files (like HTML, md, etc). 

## A more substantial change? 

Please try to follow these guidelines: 

 - Discuss the change in an issue before submitting. 
 - Try to keep the scope of a specific PR as small as possible.
 - Try to change only the source files (e.g., `qmd`, `bib`, etc.).
 - Please stick to the R ecosystem. 
 - The edits cannot include exact code that is under another license (i.e., don't just copy/paste from R sources, etc.)
 - Respect the existing code formatting/linting (as heterogeneous as it is).
