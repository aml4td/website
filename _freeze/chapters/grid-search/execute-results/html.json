It creates a pre-defined set of candidate values and computes performance from each. From there, the numerically best candidate could be chosen, or the relationship between the tuning parameters and model performance can be inspected to see if additional optimization might benefit the model. \n\nSuppose there is a single tuning parameter, as in the $n_{min}$ example of @sec-grid-and-sequential; each candidate takes a scalar value (quantitative or qualitative). In other cases, there are multiple tuning parameters. The K-nearest neighbors model discussed below has at least two tuning parameter dimensions for each candidate. Pre- and postprocessig operations have tuning parmeters.\n\nThe previous chapter demonstrated that using external data to evaluate the model is crucial (be it resampling or a validation set). Grid search has no free lunch: we cannot simply fit the model and evaluate it by predicting the same data. \n\n@alg-grid-search illustrates the process. For a model with $m$ tuning parameters, we let $\\Theta$ represent the collection of $s$ candidate values. For each specific value ($\\theta_j$), we resample the model to produce some measure of efficacy (e.g., $R^2$, accuracy, etc.)^[This process was illustrated in [Algorithm 9.1](tmp_resampling.html#alg-resampling).]. From there, the best value is chosen, or additional work is carried out to find a suitable candidate. \n\n\n::: {#alg-grid-search}\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"20%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n```pseudocode\n#| html-indent-size: \"1.2em\"\n#| html-comment-delimiter: \"//\"\n#| html-line-number: true\n#| html-line-number-punc: \":\"\n#| html-no-end: false\n\n\\begin{algorithm}\n\\caption{Grid search for tuning parameter optimization that loops over the resampling algorithm shown in TODO.}\n\\begin{algorithmic}\n\\State $D$: training set\n\\State $B$: number of resamples\n\\State $f()$: modeling function\n\\State $\\Theta$: Parameter set ($s \\times m$) with candidates $\\theta_j$\n\\For{$j=1$ \\To $m$}\n  \\State Generate $\\bar{Q}_{j} =$ \\Call{Resample}{$D, B, f(\\cdot; \\theta_j)$} corresponding to candidate $\\theta_j$.\n\\EndFor\n\\State Determine $\\hat{\\theta}_{opt}$ that optimizes $\\bar{Q}_{j}$.\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n```\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"20%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\nA formalization of how grid search is used with resampling. \n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate, this chapter will initially focus on grids for a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model with two tuning parameters^[These are described in more detail in @sec-cls-knn]. As described in @sec-isomap, KNN finds the _K_ most similar data point in the training set and uses the training set outcomes to predict a new point. The number of neighbors is a tuning parameter. For our example, we’ll consider 2 to 50 neighbors. Another parameter focuses on how to compute the distance. There are a lot of different choices and several commonly used distance metrics are special cases of Minkowski distance:\n\n$$\nd\\left(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{x}'\\right)={\\biggl(}\\sum_{j=1}^{p}|x_{j}-x_{j}'|^{\\phi}{\\biggr)}^{\\frac {1}{\\phi}}.\n$$  {#eq-minkowski}\n\nThe value $\\phi$ governs the order of the distance with $\\phi = 2$ corresponding to Euclidean space while $\\phi = 1$ is Manhattan distance. We’ll look at distances with $\\phi \\in [1.0, 2.0]$.  We'll illustrate different strategies using this model setup with varying configurations of these two tuning parameters. \n\nThere are two main classes of grids: regular and irregular. We can view generating a collection of candidate models as a statistical design of experiments (DOE) problem [@BHH]. There is a long history of DOE, and we'll invoke relevant methods for each grid type. @santner2018design and @gramacy2020surrogates have excellent overviews of the DOE methods discussed in this chapter. \n\nThe following two sections describe different methods for creating the candidate set $\\Theta$. Subsequent sections describe strategies for making grid search efficient using tools such as parallel processing and model racing. \n\n## Regular grids {#sec-regular-grid}\n\nA regular grid starts with a sequence or set of values for each tuning parameter and then creates all combinations. In statistics, this is referred to as a factorial design. The number of values per tuning parameter does not have to be the same. \n\nTo illustrate a regular grid, we'll use five values of the number of neighbors (K = 2, 14, 26, 38, and 50) and three values of the distance order ($\\phi$ = 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0). This grid of 15 candidates is shown in @fig-knn-grids. The grid covers the entire space with significant gaps in between.  \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Three types of grids (in columns) are illustrated with tuning parameters from a K-nearest neighbor model. Each grid contains 15 candidates. The space-filling design was created using the MaxiMin method described in @sec-irregular-grid.](../figures/fig-knn-grids-1.svg){#fig-knn-grids fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-knn-regular-grid-tuning plots the results when tuning the simulated training set in @sec-complexity-overfitting with 10-fold cross-validation. Brier scores were used to measure how well the model succeeded at predicting the data. The plot shows that using a small number of nearest neighbors is not great (due to overfitting) and that the Minkowski distance parameter matters little for these data. Even though this is not a diverse set of candidate values, we can probably pick out a reasonable candidate with a small Brier score, such as 26 neighbors and and a Minkowski distance order of 1.5 (although any of the values of $\\phi$ would be good choices). \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The tuning results for the regular grid shown in @fig-knn-grids.](../figures/fig-knn-regular-grid-tuning-1.svg){#fig-knn-regular-grid-tuning fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nice thing about regular grids is that you can learn much from the tuning results. It is possible for tuning parameters to interact with one another (in the same manner as predictors in @sec-interactions). This can usually be seen when visualizing the results of a regular grid. In our KNN example, the three profiles have roughly the same relationship with the performance metric. This indicates that the impact of these parameters is additive. Understanding how a model's tuning parameters affect performance can help improve model optimization. \n\nThe primary downside to regular grids is that, as the number of tuning parameters increases, the number of points required to fill the space becomes extremely large (due to the curve of dimensionality). However, for some models and pre-processing methods, regular grids can be very efficient despite the number of tuning parameters (see the following section that describes the \"submodel trick\").  \n\n## Irregular grids {#sec-irregular-grid}\n\nIrregular grids are not factorial in nature. A simple example is a _random grid_ where points are randomly placed using a uniform distribution. A design of size 15 is shown in @fig-knn-grids. There are some gaps and clustering of the points, but the space is covered well. The tuning results are shown in the top panels of @fig-knn-irregular-grid-tuning. Because it is an irregular design, we can't use the same visualization as in @fig-knn-regular-grid-tuning. Instead, a \"marginal\" plot is shown, where each numeric tuning parameter is plotted against performance in a separate panel. \n\nThe top left pbael illustrates that there is a clear signal that the number of neighbors matters for these data. Recall that each point also corresponds to different values of the Minkowski parameter.   With an irregular design, the relationship between the number of neighbors and the Brier score can only be well-defined when the other parameters don’t have much impact on the model. \n\nThe top right panel is less clear regarding a relationship between the Minkowski parameter and the Brier score. From the regular grid results in @fig-knn-grids, we know definitively that there isn’t^[At least for this range of $\\phi$.]. However, for the random it may appear that something going on. The problem is that the two-neighbor model result is so poor that the location of its matching Minkowski parameter value may influence our impression of an effect. This wasn’t an issue in the regular design since you get to see all combinations of the two parameters.  The numerically best candidate was not too dissimilar from the regular grid: 21 neighbors and and a Minkowski distance order of 1.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The tuning results for the irregular grids shown in @fig-knn-grids. The lines are spline smooths.](../figures/fig-knn-irregular-grid-tuning-1.svg){#fig-knn-irregular-grid-tuning fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this example, the patterns for the number of neighbors do not change across values of the Minkowski distance parameter (i.e., there is no interaction). If this were not the case, the relationship between these parameters and performance would be more difficult to understand. Examples of this will be seen in later chapters, such as in TODO and TODO.\n\nAnother type of irregular grid is a _space-filling design_ [@joseph2016space], where the goal is to make sure that the tuning parameter space is covered and that there is minimal redundancy in the candidate values. There are a variety of methods for achieving this goal. \n\nFor example, @fig-knn-grids shows a 15 point “Audze-Eglais“ space-filling design. The space is covered more compactly than the regular design of the same size and is much more uniform than the 15 point random design. The lower panels of @fig-knn-irregular-grid-tuning show the tuning results. The results are somewhat cleaner than the random grid results but would lead to the same conclusions. Here, the best candidate was similar to those found by the random grid: 19 neighbors and and a Minkowski distance order of 1.8. \n\nThere are many types of space-filling designs, and it is worth taking the time to take a quick tour of some of them. \n\nThe Latin hypercube design (LHD) is the most popular method for constructing space-filling designs [@Viana2016; @husslage2011space]. These designs have a simple definition. Suppose our hyperparameter space is rectangular and partitioned into smaller (hyper)cubes. In that case, a LHD is a set of distinct points where no one dimension has multiple values in any bins^[Other applications may want the points to have properties such as orthogonality, symmetry, etc.]. We desire candidates that fill the space of each parameter and are not close to one another. \n\nThe most basic approach to creating a Latin hypercube design is random sampling [@Mckay2000]. If there are $m$ parameters and we request $s$ candidate values, the parameter space is initially divided into $s^m$ hypercubes of equal size. For each tuning parameter, $s$ regions in its dimension are selected at random, and a value is placed in this box (also at random). This process repeats for each dimension. Suppose there are ten bins for a parameter that ranges between zero and one. If the first design point selects bin two, a random uniform value is created in the range `[0.1 0.2)`.  @fig-lhs-sampled shows three such designs, each generated with different random numbers. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Three replicate Latin hypercube sampling designs of size ten for two parameters. Each design uses different random numbers. The grid lines illustrate the 100 hypercubes used to generate the values.](../figures/fig-lhs-sampled-1.svg){#fig-lhs-sampled fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, these designs cover the space of each predictor univariately. However, large multivariate regions can be empty. For example, one design only samples combinations along the diagonal. Additional constraints can make the design more consistent with our desires. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, we could choose points to maximize the minimum pairwise distances between the candidates. These designs are usually referred to as MaxiMin designs [@pronzato2017minimax]. Comparing the two irregular designs in @fig-knn-grids, the random grid has a maximum minimum distance value of 0.08. In contrast, the corresponding space-filling design's value (0.25) is 3.1-fold larger^[Using Euclidean distance.]. The latter design was optimized its coverage, and we can see far less redundancy in the optimized design. \n\nA similar method, initially proposed by @audze1977new, maximizes a function of the inverse distances between $s$ candidate points: \n\n$$\ncriterion = \\sum_{i=1}^s \\sum_{j=1,\\;i\\ne j}^s\\frac{1}{dist(\\theta_i, \\theta_j)^2}\n$$\n@bates2004formulation devised search methods to find optimal designs for this criterion.\n\nSome other space-filling designs of note: \n\n- Maximum entropy sampling selects points based on assumptions related to the distributions of the tuning parameters and their covariance matrix [@shewry1987maximum;@joseph2015maximum]. \n\n- Uniform designs [@fang2000uniform;@wang2022design] are designs that optimally allocate points so that they are uniformly distributed in the space. \n\nWhile these methods can be constructed generally by sampling random points and using a search method to optimize a specific criterion, there has been scholarship that has pre-optimized designs for some combination of the number of tuning parameters and the requested grid size. \n\nThe advantage of space-filling designs over random designs is that, for smaller designs, the candidates do a better job covering the space and have a low probability of producing redundant points. Also, it is possible to create a space-filling design so that the candidates for each numerical parameter are nearly equally spaced (as was done in @fig-knn-grids). \n\nMany designs assume that all the tuning parameter values are quantitative. That may not always be the case. For example, KNN can adjust its predictions by considering how far the neighbors are from a new point; more distant points should not have the same influence as close neighbors. A weighting function can be used for this purpose. For example, weights based on an inverse function may produce better results. Equal weighting is often called a “rectangular weighting” function. As a simple workaround, the unique parameter values are repeated as if they were $s$ distinct values when making the design. This allows them to be used with a Latin hypercube design and any space-filling design that uses this approach is not technically optimal. Practically speaking, this is an effective approach for tuning models.  However, there are _sliced_ LHD that can accomplish the same goal [@qian2012sliced;@ba2015optimal].\n\nWe recommend space-filling designs since they are more efficient than regular designs. Regular designs have a lot of benefits when using an unfamiliar modeling methodology since you will learn a lot more about the nuances of how the tuning parameters affect one another. \n\n## Efficient Computations for Grid Search {#sec-efficient-grid}\n\nThe computational cost of grid search can become large, depending on the resampling strategy and the number of candidates under consideration. In our example, a total of 150 KNN models are evaluated before determining which candidates are most favorable to our data. \n\nFortunately, none of these 150 models depend on one another and can be computed separately. Since almost all modern computers have multiple CPUs and GPUs, we can break the computations into different \"chunks\" of work and execute them simultaneously on other processors (or separate computers entirely). The parallel processing of models can significantly reduce the time it takes to tune using grid search.\n\nwhen does this become more effective? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the meager computation costs of tuning the KNN model, there was still a 5.3-fold speedup (11.9s versus 2.3s) when using 10 parallel workers. \nThere are some nuances related to parallel processing. It is an excellent idea to parallelize the \"longest loop\" (literally or figuratively). \n\n* Parallel individual model fits or resampling. \n* data preprocessing conditional computations\n* keep data on one core or shotgun approach See @tmwr [Section 13.5.2](https://www.tmwr.org/grid-search#parallel-processing)\n\nTODO move all timing computations to a separate file for batch processing\n\nAlso, some models can exploit the \"submodel trick,” where a single training model can predict many tuning parameter candidates. For example, the glmnet model (@sec-penalized-logistic-regression) can compute the model coefficients for _all_ penalty values. If we tune the penalty value, a single model fit can evaluate numerous candidate values (assuming all other tuning parameters are the same). For a regular grid, this can effectively drop a dimension of the computations. Some different models and pre-processors can have this quality, including boosted trees (@sec-boosting-cls), partial least squares (@sec-colinear-projections), principal component feature extraction (@sec-linear-feature-extraction), and others. \n\nUnfortunately, irregular designs cannot exploit the submodel trick mentioned in the previous section. \n\n## Grid Search via Racing {#sec-racing}\n\nSummed up in @alg-race.\n\n::: {#alg-race}\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"80%\"}\n```pseudocode\n#| label: alg-race\n#| html-indent-size: \"1.2em\"\n#| html-comment-delimiter: \"//\"\n#| html-line-number: true\n#| html-line-number-punc: \":\"\n#| html-no-end: false\n\n\\begin{algorithm}\n\\caption{Racing tuning parameter optimization}\n\\begin{algorithmic}\n\\State $D$: training set\n\\State $B$: number of resamples\n\\State Define initial number of resamples $1 \\lt B_{min} \\lt B$ \n\\State $f()$: modeling function\n\\State $\\Theta$: Parameter set ($s \\times m$) with candidates $\\theta_j$\n\\For{$j=1$ \\To $m$}\n  \\State Generate $\\bar{Q}_{j} =$ \\Call{Resample}{$D, B_{min}, f(\\cdot; \\theta_j)$} corresponding to candidate $\\theta_j$.\n\\EndFor\n\\State Eliminate candidates so that only $s_i$ remain. \n  \\For{$k = B_{min} + 1$ \\To $B$} \n    \\State Generate $\\bar{Q}_j^k =$ \\Call{Resample}{$D, k, f(\\cdot; \\theta_j)$} corresponding to candidate $\\theta_j$ as of resample $k$.\n    \\State Eliminate candidates so that only $s_k$ remain. \n  \\Endfor\n\\State Determine $\\hat{\\theta}_{opt}$ that optimizes $\\bar{Q}_j^k$.   \n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\nThe process of using racing with grid search.\n\n:::\n\n## Optimization Bias and Nested Resampling {#sec-nested-resampling}\n\n\n## Chapter References {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
