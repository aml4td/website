How can we adaptively optimize tuning parameters in a sequential manner? Perhaps more importantly, _when_ is this a good approach? \n\nPreviously, we’ve seen that a plateau of good performance in the parameter space can be  possible. This is often the case but will not always be true. If the region of optimal performance is small, we must create a large space-filling design to find it. When there are many tuning parameters, the computational expense can be unreasonable. An even worse situation is one where the previously described speed-up techniques (such as the submodel trick from @sec-submodels) are not applicable. Racing can be very efficient, but if the training set is very large, it may be that a validation set is more appropriate than multiple resamples; racing cannot be used in this situation. Finally, there are practical considerations when the data set is very large. Most parallel processing techniques require the data to be in memory for each parallel worker, rendering that technique moot. \n\nGenerally, we are not often constrained by these issues _for models used for tabular data_. However, there are a few models that might be better optimized sequentially. The first two that come to mind are large neural networks^[Sections [-@sec-cls-svm] and [-@sec-reg-svm]]. and support vector machines^[Sections [-@sec-cls-nnet] and [-@sec-reg-nnet]] (SVMs) [@scholkopf2001;@cristianini2004]. For the former, as the number of layers increases, so does the number of tuning parameters. Neural networks also have many important tuning parameters associated with the model’s training, such as the learning rate, regularization parameters, etc. These models also require more preprocessing than others; they are suspectable to uninformative predictors, missing data, and collinearity. Depending on the data set, there can be many pre-model tuning parameters. \n\nSupport vector machines are models with fewer tuning parameters than neural networks but with similar preprocessing requirements. Unfortunately, the tuning parameter space can have large areas of poor performance with \"islands\" where the model works well. The location of these can change from data set to data set. We’ll see an example of this shortly in a small, two-parameter example. \n\nThese two models, in particular, are more likely to benefit from an optimization method that chooses candidates as the process evolves. \n\nIn theory, any iterative optimization procedures can be used. In general, gradient methods, such as steepest descent or Newton’s method, are the most commonly used technique for nonlinear optimization. These tools are suboptimal when it comes to parameter tuning but play important parts in other areas of machine learning and, for this reason, they will be discussed later. \n\nDerivative-free techniques can be helpful when tuning parameters, and there are many that can be used for nonlinear optimizations. Traditional examples are genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, etc. We’ll consider the first two of these in Sections [-@sec-sim-anneal] and [-@sec-genetic-algo]. Currently, the most well-known iterative tool for tuning models is Bayesian optimization. This will be examined in @sec-bayes-opt. However, before this, @sec-bayes will flesh out what it means for a model to be Bayesian. \n\nTo get started, let's revisit a data set. \n\n## Example: Predicting Barley Amounts using Support Vector Machines {#sec-barley-svm}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll return to the data previously seen in @sec-barley where we want to predict the percentage of barley oil in a mixture. Recall that the predictors are extremely correlated with one another. In @sec-embeddings, we considered embedding methods like PCA to preprocess the data and these models were able to achieve RMSE values of about 6% (shown in @fig-barley-linear-bakeoff). \n\nIn this chapter, we’ll model these data in two different scenarios. First, we’ll use them as a \"toy problem\" where only two support vector machine tuning parameters are optimized. This is a little unrealistic, but it allows us to visualize how iterative search methods work in a 2D space. Second, in @sec-bayes-opt-nnet, we’ll get serious and optimize a larger group of parameters for neural networks simultaneously with three parameters of a specialized preprocessing technique. \n\nLet's start with the toy example that uses an SVM regression model. This highly flexible nonlinear model can represent the predictor data in higher dimensions using a _kernel transformation_ [@hofmann2008]. This type of function combines numeric predictor vectors from two data points using a dot product. There are many different types of kernel functions, but for a _polynomial_ kernel, it is: \n\n$$\nk(\\boldsymbol{x}_1, \\boldsymbol{x}_2) = (a\\boldsymbol{x}_1'\\boldsymbol{x}_2 + b)^q\n$$ {#eq-kernel-poly}\n\nwhere $a$ is called the scaling factor, $b$ is a constant offset value, and $q$ is the polynomial degree. The dot product of predictor vectors ($\\boldsymbol{x}_i$) measures both angle and distance. Note that for the kernel function to work in an appropriate way, the two vectors must have elements with consistent units (i.e., they have been standardized). \n\nThe kernel function operates much like a polynomial basis expansion; it projects a data point into a much larger, nonlinear space. The idea is that a more complex representation of the predictors might enable the model to make better predictions. \n\nFor our toy example, we'll take the 550 predictors, project them to a smaller space of 10 principal components, then standardize those features to have the same mean and standard deviation. A quartic polynomial is used with zero offset. The scale parameter $a$ will be tuned. It helps define how much influence the dot product has in the polynomial expansion. \n\nThe most commonly tuned SVM parameter is independent of the different kernel functions: the _cost value_. This dictates how much a poorly predicted model should penalize the performance metric (when evaluated on the training set). Higher cost values will encourage the SVM to become increasingly more complex. We've previously seen the effect of modulating the SVM cost value in @fig-two-class-overfit. For small costs, the SVM classification model did not try too hard to classify samples correctly. When increased to an extreme, it significantly overfit the training set points.\n\nJust as in @sec-embeddings, the RMSE will be computed from a validation set and these statistics will be used to guide our efforts. \n\nLet's define a wide  space for our two tuning parameters: cost will vary from 2<sup>-10</sup> to 2<sup>10</sup> and the scale factor^[Why do these two parameters use different bases? It’s mostly a convention. Both parameters have valid values that can range across many orders of magnitude. The change in cost tends to occur more slowly than the scaling factor, so a smaller base of 2 is often used.] is allowed to range from 10<sup>-10</sup> to 10<sup>-0.1</sup>. @fig-svm-grid visualizes the RMSE across these ranges^[These are not simulated data, so this surface is an approximation of the true RMSE via the validation set using a very large regular grid. The RMSE results are estimates and would change if we used different random numbers for data splitting.] where darker colors indicate smaller RMSE values. The lower left diagonal area is a virtual \"dead zone\" with very large RMSE results that don't appear to change much. There is also a diagonal wedge of good performance (symbolized by the darker colors). The figure shows the location of the smallest RMSE value and a diagonal ridge of parameter combinations with nearly equal results. Any points on this line would produce good models (at least for this toy example). Note that there is a small locale of excessively large RMSE values in the upper right. Increasing both tuning parameters to their upper limits is a bad idea.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A visualization of model performance when only the SVM cost and scaling factor parameters are optimized. It shows the combination with the smallest RMSE and a ridge of candidate values with nearly equivalent performance.](../figures/fig-svm-grid-1.svg){#fig-svm-grid fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next section will discuss gradient descent optimization and why it isn’t a good choice for model tuning. The two subsequent sections will discuss how two traditional global search methods, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, can be used to search the parameter space. After this, the focus is on Bayesian optimization. Finally, we end with an extended analysis of the barley prediction problem. \n\n## Sidebar: Gradient-Based Optimization\n\nTo formalize the idea of optimization, we must have an **objective function** that defines what we are trying to optimize. This can also be called a loss function (specifically to be minimized). In either case, this value is signified by $\\psi()$. The parameters that modify $\\psi()$ are denoted as $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, which is $p \\times 1$ in dimension and is assumed to be real numbers. We'll also assume that $\\psi()$ is smooth and generally differentiable and, without losing generality, assume that smaller values are better. \n\nWe’ll denote the first derivative ($\\psi'(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$), for simplicity, as $g(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$. The matrix of second deriviatives, called the Hessian matrix, is symbolized as $H(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$. \n\nWe start with an initial guess, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$, and compute the gradient at this point, yielding a $p$ dimensional directional vector. To get to our next parameter value, simple gradient descent uses the update:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i - \\alpha\\:g(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i)\n$$ {#eq-gd-step}\n\nThe value $\\alpha$ defines how far we should travel in our new direction. This can be a constant value^[We’ve seen $\\alpha$ before when it was called the learning rate (and will revisit it later in this chapter).] or a secondary procedure, called a line search, can be used to increase the value of $\\alpha$ until the objective function worsens.\n\nWe proceed to iterate this process until some measure of convergence is achieved. For example, the optimization could be halted if the objective function does not improve more than a very small value. @lu2022gradient and @zhang2019gradient are excellent introductions to gradient-based optimization that is focused on training models.\n\nAs a simple demonstration, @fig-grad-descent shows $\\psi(\\theta) = \\theta\\: cos(\\theta/2)$ for values of $\\theta$ between $\\pm 10.0$. We want to minimize this function. There is a _global_ minimum at about $\\theta \\approx 6.85$ while there are _local_ minima at $\\theta = -10.0$ and $\\theta \\approx -1.72$. These are false solutions where some search procedures might become trapped. \n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"90%\"}\n\n::: {#fig-grad-descent}\n\n::: {.figure-content}\n\n```{shinylive-r}\n#| label: fig-grad-descent\n#| viewerHeight: 600\n#| viewerWidth: \"100%\"\n#| standalone: true\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(bslib)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# source(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aml4td/website/main/R/shiny-setup.R\")\nlight_bg <- \"#fcfefe\" # from aml4td.scss\ngrid_theme <- bs_theme(\n  bg = light_bg, fg = \"#595959\"\n)\n\ntheme_light_bl<- function(...) {\n  \n  ret <- ggplot2::theme_bw(...)\n  \n  col_rect <- ggplot2::element_rect(fill = light_bg, colour = light_bg)\n  ret$panel.background  <- col_rect\n  ret$plot.background   <- col_rect\n  ret$legend.background <- col_rect\n  ret$legend.key        <- col_rect\n  \n  ret$legend.position <- \"top\"\n  \n  ret\n}\n\nui <- page_fillable(\n  theme = bs_theme(bg = \"#fcfefe\", fg = \"#595959\"),\n  padding = \"1rem\",\n  layout_columns(\n    fill = FALSE,\n    col_widths = breakpoints(xs = c(3, 3, 3, 3), sm = 4),\n    column(\n      width = 12,\n      sliderInput(\n        \"start\",\n        label = \"Starting Value\",\n        min = -6,\n        max = 10,\n        value = 3,\n        step = 1\n      )\n    ),\n    column(\n      width = 12,\n      numericInput(\n        \"rate\",\n        label = \"Leaning Rate\",\n        min = 0,\n        max = 3,\n        value = 2,\n        step = 0.1\n      ),\n      checkboxInput(\n        \"decay\",\n        label = \"Decay?\",\n        value = FALSE\n      )\n    ),\n    column(\n      width = 12,\n      sliderInput(\n        \"iter\",\n        label = \"Iteration\",\n        min = 0L,\n        max = 50L,\n        step = 1L,\n        value = 0L,\n        width = \"100%\"\n      )\n    )\n  ),\n  as_fill_carrier(plotOutput(\"iterations\"))\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  library(ggplot2)\n  library(dplyr)\n  \n  cyclic <- function(epoch, initial = 0.001, largest = 0.1, step_size = 5) {\n    if (largest < initial) {\n      tmp <- initial\n      largest <- initial\n      initial <- tmp\n    } else if (largest == initial) {\n      initial <- initial / 10\n    }\n    cycle <- floor( 1 + (epoch / 2 / step_size) )\n    x <- abs( ( epoch / step_size ) -

Consider a few configurations:\n\n- Starting at $\\theta = 3$, a learning rate of $\\alpha = 2.0$ is inappropriate. The search initially moves towards the global minimum but then reverses course _past_ the best value and becomes trapped around one of the local optima. \n\n- If we keep $\\theta = 3$ and decrease learning rate to $\\alpha = 1.0$, we quickly find the best result. \n\n- However, if we tried decreasing the learning rate too low, say $\\alpha = 0.01$, the optimization moves too slowly. \n\nClearly, the learning rate is important.  The starting value also matters; values less than 2.0 never appear to reach the optimum. \n\nThis gradient descent algorithm outlined above is extremely basic. There are far more complex versions, the most well-known of which is the Newton-Raphson method (a.k.a. Newton’s Method) that incorporates second derivatives ($H(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$) in the updating formula^[However, computing the Hessian matrix increases the computational cost by about 3-fold.]. \n\nWe often know _when_ gradient-based optimization will work well. If we know the equation for the objective function, we can determine its properties, such as whether it is a convex function, and theory can tell us if a global optimum can be foundvia the use of gradients. For example, squared error loss $\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = (y-\\hat{y})^2$, is convex when  the relationship for the predicted value $\\hat{y}$ is a well-behaved function of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ (such as in linear regression). \n\nHowever, there are additional considerations when it comes to optimizations for predictive models. First, since data are not deterministic, the loss function is not only a random variable but can be excessively noisy. This noise can have a detrimental effect on how well the optimization proceeds. \n\nSecond, our objective function is usually a performance metric (such as RMSE) and not all metrics are mathematically well-behaved (or smooth or convex). In the case of deep neural networks, the model equations can lead to a non-convex function even when the objective function itself is simple (e.g., squared error loss).  In this case, we must worry that our optimized parameters correspond to a local optimum, not a global one. This can occur because traditional gradient methods are _greedy_; they proceed in a direction that is always optimal for the current estimates of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. This makes a lot of sense and is mostly effective. However, with complex or non-standard objective functions, the optimization can get stuck in a local optimum.\n\nThere are additional complications related to model tuning. In this case, the $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ values are the tuning parameters. These might not be real numbers. For example, the number of spline terms is a whole number, and the updating equation might yield a fractional value for the number of terms. Still other parameters are qualitative in nature, such as the type of activation function in a neural network. \n\nDuring model tuning, we know not to repredict the training set (due to overfitting). Procedures such as resampling make the evaluation of $\\psi()$ computationally expensive since multiple models should be trained. Unless we use symbolic gradient equations, the numerical process of approximating the gradient vector $g(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ can require a large number of function evaluations. \n\nLater, we’ll discuss *stochastic gradient descent* (SGD)[@udl2023,Chapter 6]. This variation is often used to train very complex networks when there is a large amount of training data. SGD is a way to approximate the gradient vector using a small subset of the data at a time. While this does cause variation in the direction of descent, this variation often has the beneficial side effect of helping to escape from local minima. Also, when there are large amounts of training data, SGD can be much faster than using the entire dataset.\n\nUntil then, the next three chapters will describe different stochastic optimization, gradient-free  methods that are well-suited for parameter tuning since they can sidestep some of the issues described above. \n\n## Simulated Annealing  {#sec-sim-anneal}\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-greedy search methods are not constrained to always proceed in the absolute best direction (as defined by the gradient). One such method is _simulated annealing_ (SA)[@spall2005introduction;@kirkpatrick1983optimization]. It is a controlled random search that moves in random directions but with some amount of control over the path. It can also incorporate restarts if the algorithm moves into clearly poor regions.\n\nGiven a starting value, SA creates a random perturbation of the current candidate solution, often residing within some local neighborhood of the current value.  The objective function is evaluated and compared to the previous value. If the new candidate produces an improvement, the process continues by using this candidate to make the next step. If it is not, there are two options: \n\n - We can accept the current value as \"suboptimal\" and base our next perturbation on it, or\n - discard the current solution as if it did not occur. The next candidate point is a perturbation of the last \"acceptable\" point. \n\nFor our SVM example, suppose we start with a candidate where $x_0 = \\left[log_2 (cost), log_{10} (scale)\\right[$ was $x_0 = [-10, -0.1]$ and had an associated RMSE value of 6.10%. For the next candidate, a perturbation of this values is created, say $x_1 = [-7.11, -0.225]$. Suppose that the corresponding RMSE was measured at 5.97%. Since $x_1$ has a better performance metric it is automatically accepted and is used to create the next parameter. \n\nHowever, suppose that our new RMSE was 7.00%, meaning that $x_1$ did worse than our initial one.  \n\nSimulated annealing generates a probability threshold for accepting the worse solution. Typically, the probability depends on two quantities: \n\n* The difference in prior and current estimates of the objective function. If the new candidate is nearly as good as the current one, the probability of acceptance should be larger than that of a severely unsatisfactory candidate. \n* The probability of acceptance should decrease over search iterations. An exponentially decaying function, called a \"cooling schedule,\" often used.\n\nAn often used equation for the probability, assuming that smaller values are better, is \n\n$$\nPr[accept] = \\exp\\Bigl[-i\\bigl(\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}) - \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i-1})\\bigr)\\Bigr]\n$$\n\nwhere $i$ is the iteration number. To compare 6.1% versus 7.0%, the acceptance probability is 40.7%. To make the determination, a random uniform number is generated and is used to compare to a random number to decide on the next step. If this difference were to occur at a later iteration, say $i = 5$, the probability would drop to 1.1%.\n\nOne small matter is related to the scale of the objective function. The difference in the exponent is very sensitive to scale. If, for example, instead of percentages we were to use the proportions 0.61 and 0.70, the probability would change from 40.7% to 91.4%. One way to mitigate this issue is to use a normalized difference by dividing the raw difference by the previous objective function (i.e., (0.70-0.61) / 0.70). This is the approach used in the SA analyses here. \n\nThis process is continued until either a pre-defined number of iterations is reached or if there is no improvement by a certain number of iterations. The best result found at any time in the optimization is used as the final value; there is no real notion of \"convergance\" for this method. Also, as previously mentioned, a restart rule can stop simulated annealing from delving too far into suboptimal regions if no best results have occurred within some period of time. When the processes is restarted, can be continue from either the last best candidate point from previous iterations or at a random point in the parameter space. \n\nHow should the candidates be perturbed from iteration to iteration? When the tuning parameters are all numeric, we can create a random distance and angle from the current values. A similar process can be used for integers by \"flooring\" them to the nearest whole number. For qualitative tuning parameters, a random subset of parameters is chosen to change to a different value chosen at random. The amount of change should be large enough to search the parameters space and potentially get out of a local optimum.\n\nIt is also important to conduct computations on the parameters in their potentially transformed space. This ensures that the entire range of the parameter values is treated equally. For example, we’ve been working with the values on their log (base 2) scale for the SVM cost parameter. When perturbing the values, we make sure to change them in the log space. This is true of all of the other search methods described in this chapter. \n\nTo illustrate, a very small initial space-filling design with three candidates was generated and evaluated. The results are in @tbl-svm-initial. To start the SA search^[These values will be also used as the initial substrate for Bayesian optimization.], we will start with the candidate with the smallest RMSE and proceed for 50 iterations without a rule for early stopping.

The open circles represent a small initial grid. The thick diagonal grey light is a ridge where the model has the smallest RMSE. The asterisk denotes the current best candidate.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"15%\"}\n:::\n\n:::: \n\nDuring the search, there were 4 iterations where a new global best result was discovered (iterations 1, 14, 15, and 40). There were also 5 restarts  at iterations 9, 23, 31, 39, and 48. In the end, the best results occurred with a cost value of 2<sup>-2.5</sup> and a scale factor of 10<sup>-0.98</sup>. The corresponding validation set RMSE was 5.78%. With this random seed, the search gets near the ridge of best performance but only lingers there for short times. It does spend a fair amount of time meandering in regions of poor performance. \n\nSimulated annealing has some attractive qualities. First, the process of creating a new candidate works for any type of parameter (e.g., real, integer, or qualitative). This isn’t the case for the two other iterative methods we’ll discuss. Also, the perturbation process is very fast; there is very little computational overhead between acquiring the next objective function value. Also, since we are effectively simulating new candidate sets, we can potentially apply constraints to parameters or groups of parameters. For example, if a tuning parameter could only be odd integers, this would not be a significant problem for simulated annealing. \n\nThere are a few downsides to this method. Compared to the other search methods, SA makes small incremental changes. If we start far away from the optimum, many iterations might be required to reach it.  One way to mitigate this issue is to do a small space-filling design and start from the best point (as we did). In fact, applying SA search after a grid search (perhaps using racing) can be a good way to verify that the grid search was effective. \n\nAnother disadvantage is that a single candidate is processed at a time. If the training set size is not excessive, we could parallel process the multiple candidates simultaneously. We could make a batch of perturbations and pick the best value to keep or apply the probabilistic process of accepting a poor value. \nThis optimization took 31.5s per candidate to execute. \n\n## Genetic Algorithms  {#sec-genetic-algo}\n\n## Bayesian Models {#sec-bayes}\n\n## Bayesian Optimization {#sec-bayes-opt}\n\n## Example: Tuning a Neural Network {#sec-bayes-opt-nnet}\n\n## Chapter References {.unnumbered}\n\n",
